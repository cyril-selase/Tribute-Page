            <h3>
                EARLY LIFE
            </h3>
            <p>
                Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro was born in São Pedro, Funchal, on the Portuguese island of Madeira,
                and
                grew up in Santo António, Funchal. He is the fourth and youngest child of Maria Dolores dos Santos
                Viveiros
                da Aveiro, a cook, and José Dinis Aveiro, a municipal gardener and part-time kit man. His
                great-grandmother
                on his father's side, Isabel da Piedade, was from the island of São Vicente, Cape Verde. He has one
                older
                brother, Hugo, and two older sisters, Elma and Liliana Cátia "Katia". His mother revealed that she
                wanted to
                abort him due to poverty, his father's alcoholism and having too many children already, but her doctor
                refused to perform the procedure. Ronaldo grew up in a Catholic and impoverished home, sharing a room
                with
                all his siblings.
            </p>

            <p>
                As a child, Ronaldo played for Andorinha from 1992 to 1995, where his father was the kit man, and later
                spent two years with Nacional. In 1997, aged 12, he went on a three-day trial with Sporting CP, who
                signed
                him for a fee of £1,500. He subsequently moved from Madeira to Alcochete, near Lisbon, to join Sporting
                youth football academy. By age 14, Ronaldo believed he had the ability to play semi-professionally, and
                agreed with his mother to cease his education in order to focus entirely on football. While popular with
                other students at school, he had been expelled after throwing a chair at his teacher, who he said had
                "disrespected" him. However, one year later, he was diagnosed with a racing heart, a condition that
                could
                have forced him to give up playing football. Ronaldo underwent heart surgery where a laser was used to
                cauterise multiple cardiac pathways into one, altering his resting heart rate. He was discharged from
                the
                hospital hours after the procedure and resumed training a few days later.

                        <p>At age 16, Ronaldo was promoted from Sporting's youth team by first-team manager László
                            Bölöni,
                            who was impressed with his dribbling. He subsequently became the first player to play for
                            the
                            club's under-16, under-17 and under-18 teams, the B team, and the first team, all within a
                            single season</p>
                        <p>A year later, on 7 October 2002, Ronaldo made his debut in the Primeira Liga, against
                            Moreirense,
                            and scored two goals in their 3–0 win. Over the course of the 2002–03 season, his
                            representatives suggested the player to Liverpool manager Gérard Houllier and Barcelona
                            president Joan Laporta. Manager Arsène Wenger, who was interested in signing the winger, met
                            with him at Arsenal's grounds in November to discuss a possible transfer.</p>
                        <p>Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson, however, was determined to acquire Ronaldo on a
                            permanent move urgently, after Sporting defeated United 3–1 at the inauguration of the
                            Estádio
                            José Alvalade in August 2003. Initially, United had just planned to sign Ronaldo and then
                            loan
                            him back to Sporting for a year. Having been impressed by him, however, the Manchester
                            United
                            players urged Ferguson to sign him. After the game, Ferguson agreed to pay Sporting £12.24
                            million for what he considered to be "one of the most exciting young players" he had ever
                            seen.
                            A decade after his departure from the club, in April 2013, Sporting honoured Ronaldo by
                            selecting him to become their 100,000th member.</p>

                            Ronaldo became Manchester United's first Portuguese player when he signed before the 2003–04
                            season. His transfer fee of £12.24 million made him, at the time, the most expensive
                            teenager in
                            English football history. Although he requested the number 28, his number at Sporting, he
                            received the number 7 shirt, which had previously been worn by such United players as George
                            Best, Eric Cantona and David Beckham. Wearing the number 7 became an extra source of
                            motivation
                            for Ronaldo. A key element in his development during his time in England proved to be his
                            manager, Alex Ferguson, of whom he later said, "He's been my father in sport, one of the
                            most
                            important and influential factors in my career."

                            Ahead of the 2009–10 season, Ronaldo joined Real Madrid for a world record transfer fee at
                            the
                            time, of £80 million (€94 million). His contract, which ran until 2015, was worth €11
                            million
                            per year and contained a €1 billion buy-out clause. At least 80,000 fans attended his
                            presentation at the Santiago Bernabéu, surpassing the 25-year record of 75,000 fans who had
                            welcomed Diego Maradona at Napoli. Since club captain Raúl already wore the number 7 (the
                            number
                            Ronaldo wore at Manchester United), Ronaldo received the number 9 shirt, which was presented
                            to
                            him by former Madrid player Alfredo Di Stéfano.

                        <p>Despite months of negotiation to sign a new Real Madrid contract, on 10 July 2018, Ronaldo
                            signed a
                            four-year contract with Italian club Juventus after completing a €100 million transfer,
                            which
                            included an additional €12 million in other fees, and solidarity contributions to Ronaldo's
                            youth
                            clubs. The transfer was the highest ever for a player over 30 years old, and the highest
                            paid by
                            an
                            Italian club. Upon signing, Ronaldo cited his need for a new challenge as his rationale for
                            departing Madrid, but later attributed the transfer to the lack of support he felt was shown
                            by
                            club
                            president Florentino Pérez.</p>
